# Problem: Reverse Linked List

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the new head of the reversed list.

### Example:

**Input:** `head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
Which looks like: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL`

**Output:** `head = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
Which should look like: `5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL`
